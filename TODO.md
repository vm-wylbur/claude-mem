# Multi-AI Memory Curation System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform reactive memory cleanup into proactive intelligent knowledge management through specialized AI agents and consensus-based decision making.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Core Architecture
- [ ] **Day 1-2: Foundation Setup**
  - [ ] Analyze existing analyze-memory-quality.ts structure and interfaces
  - [ ] Identify extension points for multi-AI integration  
  - [ ] Map current MemoryQualityAnalysis interface to multi-AI requirements
  - [ ] Document existing database schema and identify needed extensions

- [ ] **Day 1-2: Agent Prompt Design**
  - [ ] Create general-curator prompt template (broad quality assessment)
  - [ ] Create security-specialist prompt template (security patterns, vulnerabilities)
  - [ ] Define structured output format for consistent agent responses
  - [ ] Build agent relevance scoring system for memory types

- [ ] **Day 3-5: Core Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement basic consensus engine with weighted voting
  - [ ] Create confidence aggregation using geometric mean
  - [ ] Add simple tie-breaking rules (defer to general-curator)
  - [ ] Build comparison framework vs existing system

- [ ] **Day 3-5: Integration**
  - [ ] Create MultiAIAnalyzeMemoryQualityTool wrapper
  - [ ] Orchestrate 2-agent analysis in sequence
  - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with current interfaces
  - [ ] Add feature flag for A/B testing

### Week 2: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Testing Framework**
  - [ ] Test with 10-20 representative memories
  - [ ] Compare multi-AI vs single-AI results
  - [ ] Measure consensus confidence and agreement rates
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking (latency, accuracy)

- [ ] **Success Gates for Week 2**
  - [ ] Multi-AI system produces reasonable results on test memories
  - [ ] Consensus algorithm successfully combines agent perspectives
  - [ ] Performance degradation < 5x single-AI system
  - [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Expansion (Weeks 3-6)

### Week 3: Additional Agent Roles
- [ ] **Expand Agent Ecosystem**
  - [ ] Add architecture-claude: Design patterns, system relationships, scaling
  - [ ] Add python-claude: Code quality, implementation patterns, libraries
  - [ ] Add research-claude: Knowledge gaps, cross-reference opportunities
  - [ ] Update relevance scoring system for 5-agent orchestration

- [ ] **Enhanced Consensus Algorithm**
  - [ ] Implement weighted voting with domain expertise weighting
  - [ ] Add structured debate phase: agents respond to each other's findings
  - [ ] Conflict resolution escalation matrix based on disagreement patterns
  - [ ] Minority opinion preservation and reporting

### Week 4: Advanced Orchestration
- [ ] **Dynamic Agent Selection**
  - [ ] Memory type → agent relevance mapping
  - [ ] Cost optimization: only invoke highly relevant agents
  - [ ] Parallel execution for independent analyses, sequential for dependent

- [ ] **Cross-Memory Pattern Analysis**
  - [ ] Batch processing for memory collections
  - [ ] Pattern detection across multiple memories
  - [ ] Relationship mapping between memories
  - [ ] Trend analysis over time

## Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Weeks 7-12)

### Week 7-8: Proactive Knowledge Enhancement
- [ ] **Research Gap Identification**
  - [ ] Cross-project knowledge dependency analysis
  - [ ] Missing documentation detection algorithms
  - [ ] Incomplete implementation chain identification
  - [ ] Knowledge island detection (isolated memories needing connecting)

- [ ] **Enhancement Recommendation Engine**
  - [ ] Memory enrichment suggestions (context, examples, cross-references)
  - [ ] Split/merge recommendations for memories
  - [ ] Follow-up research suggestions
  - [ ] Priority scoring for enhancement opportunities

### Week 9-10: Cross-Project Intelligence
- [ ] **Multi-Project Pattern Synthesis**
  - [ ] Solution template extraction from successful patterns
  - [ ] Cross-project learning opportunity identification
  - [ ] Best practice propagation recommendations
  - [ ] Anti-pattern warning system

- [ ] **Strategic Knowledge Management**
  - [ ] Project health assessment based on memory quality
  - [ ] Knowledge risk identification (bus factor analysis)
  - [ ] Strategic documentation gap analysis
  - [ ] Team knowledge distribution insights

## Phase 4: Production Integration (Weeks 11-14)

### Week 11-12: Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Production Optimization**
  - [ ] Performance tuning: caching strategies, batch processing optimization
  - [ ] Cost monitoring and budget controls (usage tracking, rate limiting)
  - [ ] Reliability improvements: graceful degradation, fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] Error handling and retry logic for multi-AI failures

- [ ] **Scalability Architecture**
  - [ ] Queue-based processing for large memory collections
  - [ ] Distributed processing capability for cross-project analysis
  - [ ] Memory-efficient algorithms for pattern detection
  - [ ] Horizontal scaling support for agent orchestration

### Week 13-14: User Integration & Documentation
- [ ] **User Interface Integration**
  - [ ] Enhanced reporting with multi-AI insights visualization
  - [ ] Confidence indicator displays for automated decisions
  - [ ] Manual override capabilities for consensus decisions
  - [ ] Historical analysis and trend reporting

- [ ] **Production Deployment**
  - [ ] Migration strategy from single-AI to multi-AI system
  - [ ] Rollback procedures and safety mechanisms
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting system setup
  - [ ] Comprehensive documentation and user guides

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Targets
- [ ] 15%+ improvement in consensus confidence over single-AI
- [ ] 25%+ reduction in false positive deletion recommendations
- [ ] <3x processing time increase vs current system

### Qualitative Validation
- [ ] User satisfaction >8/10 for pattern recognition quality
- [ ] Successful cross-project knowledge synthesis demonstrations
- [ ] Reliable autonomous operation with graceful degradation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Orchestration complexity → Phased implementation, start simple
- [ ] Performance degradation → Monitoring + fallback systems
- [ ] Integration issues → Backward compatibility maintained

### Operational Risks
- [ ] Cost control → Usage tracking, A/B testing
- [ ] Reliability → Graceful degradation, fallback to single-AI
- [ ] User adoption → Clear value demonstration, gradual migration

## Architecture Notes

### Agent Role Definitions
```typescript
interface AgentRole {
  name: string;
  specialization: string[];
  promptTemplate: string;
  relevanceScoring: (memory: Memory) => number;
}

// Initial agents:
// - general-curator: quality, general-analysis, lifecycle
// - security-specialist: security, vulnerabilities, compliance
```

### Consensus Algorithm
```typescript
interface AgentAnalysis {
  agentRole: string;
  confidenceScore: number;
  relevanceScore: number;
  findings: MemoryQualityIssue[];
  deleteRecommendation: boolean;
}

interface ConsensusResult {
  finalDecision: boolean;
  consensusConfidence: number;
  agreementLevel: number;
  minorityViews: string[];
}
```
