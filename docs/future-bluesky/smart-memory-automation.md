# Feature Request: Smart Memory Automation

## Summary
Enhance the memory system with automated capture and discovery capabilities to improve ease of use and reduce cognitive load.

## Implementation Status
- âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: Tag browsing functionality (`get-all-tags`, `list-memories-by-tag`)
- ðŸš§ **Phase 1 Extensions**: Natural language capture and enhanced UX (in progress)
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 2**: Advanced automation and intelligence (planned)

## Features

### Phase 1: Enhanced Discovery & Navigation âœ…
- âœ… **Tag/Category Browsing** - Users can explore memories by topic using tag filtering
- âœ… **Tag Discovery** - Get all available tags to understand what topics exist
- ðŸ“‹ **Timeline View** - Historical exploration of stored memories (planned)

### Phase 1 Extensions: Natural Language & UX ðŸš§
*Inspired by [mcp-mem0](https://github.com/coleam00/mcp-mem0) analysis*

6. **Quick Memory Capture** ðŸ”¥  
   - Add `quick-store` tool that accepts natural language input
   - Auto-detect memory type and generate appropriate metadata
   - Reduce friction for rapid memory capture during work sessions

7. **Context Awareness** ðŸ”¥  
   - Add `get-recent-context` tool for retrieving last N memories across all types
   - Enable full context retrieval without manual memory ID management
   - Better continuity between work sessions

8. **Enhanced Search Experience** ðŸ”¥  
   - Display similarity scores and result ranking
   - Add date range filtering for temporal search
   - Improve search result presentation and usability

### Phase 2: Automation & Intelligence ðŸ“‹
*Advanced features requiring behavioral analysis*

1. **Automatic Memory Suggestions**  
   - Automatically suggest capturing new memories based on detected patterns in user activity (e.g., debugging sessions, code commits)
   - Provide proactive prompts for memory capture when significant events occur

2. **Pattern-Based Auto-Remember**  
   - Enable pattern matching for phrases that should trigger automatic memory storage (e.g., "bug fixed", "solution found", "decision made")

4. **Template-Based Memory Creation**  
   - Offer structured templates for different memory types (e.g., debugging, decisions)
   - Allow users to fill in templates rather than starting from scratch

5. **Intelligent Linking**  
   - Suggest related memories based on content similarity to build a connected knowledge web
   - Automatic memory conflict detection and resolution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸ“‹
*Future enhancements for power users*

9. **Memory Lifecycle Management**
   - Automatic memory expiration and archiving
   - Memory importance scoring and cleanup
   - Cross-memory intelligence and duplicate detection

10. **Provider-Agnostic Configuration** ðŸ”¬
    - Support multiple embedding providers (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter)
    - Fallback strategies for embedding generation
    - Environment-based provider switching

## Expected Benefits

- Reduced need for manual memory management.
- Easier discovery of existing memories and insights.
- Lower cognitive load on users by handling memory organization automatically.
- Enhanced knowledge retention and context preservation.

## Next Steps

1. Define specific automation patterns and decide how they can trigger capture suggestions.
2. Develop UI/UX changes needed for enhanced discovery and navigation features.
3. Implement backend logic to support new automation and linking capabilities.
4. Conduct user testing to refine automated suggestions and templates.
